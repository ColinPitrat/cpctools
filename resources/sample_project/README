This is a sample project showing how to use link.ld and cpc.mk

cpc.mk is a generic makefile for CPC projects. It defines a set of implicit
rules so make knows how to handle the usual CPC files.

This makes it very easy to build a project without the need for much information
in the makefile.

cpc.mk assumes the use of vasm, and supports:
* Multiple source z80 files
* Support for screen pictures (converts PNG to SCR files) with different video modes (you can set the SCREENMODE variable globally or on each .scr file target)
* Support for exomizer and automatically crunching files when they are updated
* Highlight of actions so it is easy to see what the Makefile is doing. The BECHO macro is modifiable if you don't like the colors.

An important thing to remember is the use of double-colon rules in combination with immplicit rules. You don't need to know all the details, just make sure you use "target:: dependencies" when specifying something.
